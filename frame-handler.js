/**
 * Example of how to handle frame button interactions on a server
 * 
 * When a user clicks a button in a Farcaster frame, the client sends a POST request
 * to the URL specified in the frame. The server needs to respond with a new frame.
 * 
 * This is pseudocode for how that would work:
 */

// Express.js server example (pseudocode)
/*
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Handle POST requests to the root URL
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  // Get the frame data from the request
  const frameData = req.body;
  
  // Check which button was clicked
  const buttonIndex = frameData.untrustedData.buttonIndex;
  
  // Generate a response based on the button clicked
  let responseFrame;

    const playerChoice = buttonIndex === 1 ? "rock" : buttonIndex === 2 ? "paper" : "scissors";
    const computerChoice = getComputerChoice();
    const result = determineWinner(playerChoice, computerChoice);
    
    // Update game state (this would be stored in a database in a real implementation)
    // For this example, we're just showing one round
    
    responseFrame = {

// Start the server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

/**
 * For a complete implementation, you would need:
 * 
 * 1. A server that can handle POST requests (Express.js, Next.js, etc.)
 * 2. A way to store game state between requests (database, session, etc.)
 * 3. Dynamic image generation for each game state
 * 4. Proper error handling and validation
 * 
 * The frame flow would be:
 * 
 * 1. Initial frame: Welcome screen with "Play Game" button
 * 2. After clicking "Play Game": Show options (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
 * 3. After making a choice: Show result and "Play Again" button
 * 4. After 5 rounds: Show final result and "Cast Win" button if player won
 * 
 * Each step would require a new frame response with the appropriate buttons and image.
